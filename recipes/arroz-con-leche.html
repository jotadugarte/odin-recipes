        <h2 class="titles">Description</h2>
        <p>This Arroz con Leche is the Cuban version of rice pudding. It's richer and sweeter than regular rice pudding. Being Cuban myself, I prefer this version of this delicious dessert to any other. Before serving, sprinkle with cinnamon or garnish with a cinnamon stick, for flair.</p>
        <h2 class="titles">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 ¼ cups water</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups short grain rice</li>
            <li>1 (1/4 inch x 3 inch) strip lime peel</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons anise seed, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup raisins (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="titles">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 1/4 cups of water, rice, and lime peel in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes until the rice is tender.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, combine 1/2 cup of water, the cinnamon stick, and anise in another saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring mixture to a low boil for 3 minutes, then remove saucepan from stove. Strain flavored water into a bowl and set aside, discarding cinnamon stick and anise pieces.</li>
            <li>After rice has simmered for 20 minutes, carefully remove the lime peel with a slotted spoon, and over low heat, gradually stir evaporated milk and condensed milk into the rice. Mix in the cinnamon and anise-flavored water, vanilla, and salt. Add raisins, if desired. Continue to stir until the mixture thickens, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If the pudding is too watery after 10 minutes, turn up heat to medium-low and stir continuously. When pudding reaches desired consistency, remove from heat and pour into individual dishes, or a large bowl. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
